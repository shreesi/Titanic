# Predicting the survivor of the titanic

We have used Label Encoder to convert categorical dataset into numerical.

For predicting the survivor of the titanic we have used svm model. We have used Standard Scalar to improve the accuracy as before Standard Scalar our model was not performing good but 
after Standard Scalar it is performing good.

We have used pickle to save our trained model in train.ipynb file.

In test.ipynb file we have used pickle model ( which was we have saved before) and predicted the value.
